This Uses An Android Agent To Open Chromium Through Pycharm Literally Copy And Paste. If You Need, Import Packages On Right Click. 

A big thing here is this is done on ubuntu with pycharm. so i can open it with snap says it right here:

  # Use the 'snap' command for Ubuntu (assuming Chromium is installed via Snap)
        command = "snap run chromium --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; Pixel 3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.89 Mobile Safari/537.36\""

you can probabaly virtualize or use a bootable usb or just use chrome and pycharm on windows. I'll come back with updates.
